# Nzulezo
The village of Nzulezo is located near the village of Beyin, 90 kilometres west of Takoradi, in the western region of Ghana. Nzulezo overlooks the Amansuri Lagoon and is entirely made up of stilts and platforms. Nzulezo serves as an interplay between man and the environment. Nzulezo was built over the Amanzuri lagoon. The settlement of Nzulezo consists of stilt-supported structures.

The reason Nzulezo was built over the water was for protection and safety during attacks in times of war since it lies five miles inland of the Southwest shores. The main activity of its inhabitants is agriculture, while the fishery plays a secondary role. 

In the year 2000, Nzulezo was nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a major tourist attraction area.
The village was nominated to become a World Heritage Site for its importance in anthropology: in addition to being one of the few ancient settlements on stilts and platforms left in the world.
Nzulezo is now the most popular tourist attraction in the western region and one of the best in of Ghana.
